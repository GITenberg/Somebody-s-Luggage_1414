description: '"My family-name is Blue-Beard! I''m going to open Somebody''s Luggage
  all alone in the Secret Chamber -- and not a female eye catches sight of the contents!"
  Such a mystery! On the first day of the year 1857, a man left his inn and requested
  his luggage be ready when he called for it -- then never called. Nor paid his small
  bill.  Christopher, a Waiter (one of a large family of Waiters, dignified and dedicated
  in their trade) is made the offer years later -- won''t he pay the small bill? And
  have the mystery all to himself?  In this delightful tale from Dickens, Christopher
  discovers more than just ordinary travel-goods, when he opens those long-locked
  valises!'
